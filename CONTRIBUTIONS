Before starting to code

Please follow these guidelines before starting to code you feature or bugfix.

    If you want to implement a bugfix or feature request from an existing issue, please comment on that issue that you will work on it. 
       This helps us to coordinate what needs to be done and what not.

    If you want to implement a feature request without an existing issue, please create an issue, so we know what you are working on 
       and discuss the feature.

    For major feature implementations make sure you are able to maintain your code in the future in regard to bugs and possible 
       code conflicts in future updates. 

    Optionally you could join the Discord channel (link below), so you will hear instantly if something needs to be worked on.

Please follow these guidelines before sending your pull request and making contributions.

    When you submit a pull request, you agree that your code is published under the  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v2.0
    Please link the issue you are referring to.
    Do not include non-free software or modules with your code.
    Make sure your pull request is set up to merge your branch to Anthias MSU-Denver Board development branch.
    Make sure your branch is up to date with the development branch before submitting your pull request.
    Stick to a similar style of code already in the project. Please look at current code to get an idea on how to do this.
    Comment your code when necessary. Follow the CSS and PYTHON Documentation and Comments Standard for functions.
    Please test your code. Make sure new features work as well as existing core features such as watching videos or loading subscriptions. 
    Please make sure your code does not violate any standards set by our linter. It's up to you to make fixes whenever necessary. 
    Please limit the amount of Node Modules that you introduce into the project. 
    Please try to stay involved with the community and maintain your code. 
    We are only a handful of developers working on the Board in our spare time.
    We do not have time to work on everything, and it would be nice if you can maintain your code when necessary.
